Ares is a company brain for Indian wholesalers and distributors.

It runs on the Hermes Agent runtime, but this repository is presented and operated as Ares: a vertical AIOS that watches business signals, remembers customer/vendor patterns, drafts owner actions, and asks for approval before anything ledger-impacting happens.

Compatible with the <a href="https://agentskills.io">agentskills.io</a> open standard.</td></tr>

Daytona and Modal offer serverless persistence — your agent's environment hibernates when idle and wakes on demand, costing nearly nothing between sessions.

## What Ares does

- Daily Battle Plan: morning owner brief with money, stock, order, and follow-up priorities.
- Payment Radar: finds overdue invoices and drafts polite collection follow-ups.
- Order Capture: turns forwarded messages into structured order drafts.
- Stock Radar: highlights low-stock and movement issues from exports.
- Business Memory: learns practical operating patterns such as customer payment habits.
- Approval Center: keeps humans in control before messages/actions are executed.
- Mobile Owner Interface: supports simple Indian-English replies like `haan appr_xxx`, `reject appr_xxx`, `baadme appr_xxx`.
- Cron/Gateway Ready: works with Hermes cron and messaging gateway for scheduled/remote operation.

## One-command setup

From a machine with `git` installed. The installer will use `uv`, and can install `uv` automatically if it is missing:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

> **Heads up:** Native Windows runs Hermes without WSL — CLI, gateway, TUI, and tools all work natively. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS one-liner above works there too. Found a bug? Please [file issues](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues).

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1)
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install). Hermes uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead. Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Hermes installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is fully supported — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; WSL2 installs under `~/.hermes` as on Linux. The only Hermes feature that currently needs WSL2 specifically is the browser-based dashboard chat pane (it uses a POSIX PTY — classic CLI and gateway both run natively).

After installation:

```bash
ares chat --client demo-wholesaler
ares autonomous-cycle --client demo-wholesaler
ares mobile-approvals --client demo-wholesaler
ares mobile-reply --client demo-wholesaler --reply "haan appr_xxx"
ares print-cron-specs --client demo-wholesaler
```

## Ares command surface

The setup script installs an `ares` wrapper, so users do not need a global Hermes install:

```bash
ares chat
ares setup
ares autonomous-cycle
ares mobile-approvals
ares mobile-reply
ares sync-drive-manifest
ares print-cron-specs
ares approval-center
ares list-clients
ares list-workflows
```

Gateway slash command:

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Hermes works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
hermes setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `hermes portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

## Runtime attribution

Ares is built on top of the open-source Hermes Agent runtime by Nous Research. Hermes provides the CLI agent, model routing, tools, memory, skills, cron scheduler, plugin system, and gateway infrastructure. Ares adds the wholesaler-specific workflows, command surface, memory patterns, approval UX, and operator runbooks.
